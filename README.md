![Offtube Image](Offtube/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/Icon-60@2x.png?raw=true)

Offtube (I know the name sucks but I haven't come up with a better one yet) is an iOS app to download Youtube videos to your iPhone and iPad so you can watch them offline. While the app will work on iPhones it has been created for the iPAd and is yet to be optimized for iPhones.

Just drop a regular Youtube link into the searchfield. Both regular links and Youtbue short links will work. Detail information on the video as well as the video itself in medium resolution will be downloaded to your device. Getting to choose the desired quality may be a feature in  future versions.

Offtube is yet *work in progress* so check back frequently for updates.
